# Cardano Governance API (CGOV)

A **public good infrastructure** for the Cardano ecosystem, providing open access to on-chain governance data.

## Why CGOV?

Cardano's governance system empowers ADA holders to participate in decision-making through DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee. However, accessing and understanding this data can be challenging.

**CGOV bridges this gap** by providing:

- Real-time governance proposal tracking
- DRep and SPO voting power information
- Constitutional Committee member status
- Treasury withdrawal and Net Change Limit (NCL) data
- Historical voting records

This API powers governance dashboards and tools, making Cardano's democratic processes more transparent and accessible to everyone.

## Public Good Commitment
