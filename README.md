# Express CSL Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate of building and submitting Cardano transaction using `cardano-serialization-lib`.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run start
The server will start on http://localhost:3000 by default.
```

## Testing

```shell
npm run test
```

## Error Handling

The API handles errors and validation using custom middleware. It guards incorrect types in request body and path param.
